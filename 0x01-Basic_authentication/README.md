 Basic Authentication

## Bachground Context
In this project, we learnt what the authentication process means and how to implement a **Basic Authentication** on a simple API.

In the industry, we should not implement our own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework(like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rpsPy0M3_FJuCLGNPUbmvg) instead. Here, for the learning purpose, we walked through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.
